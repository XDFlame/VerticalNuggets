--------------------------------------------------
# v1.0.2.1

Another re-release
- Pack now has a separate download for each Minecraft version
- Exceptions: 1.11 & 1.12, 1.13 & 1.14 - each pair uses the same pack format (and nobody plays them anyway lol)
- This was done because other texture packs do the same thing, and I personally dislike having the "incompatible with this version!" warning because it's kind of annoying
- Also changed file names so you can easily tell which one has the correct pack formats
- Old CurseForge versions archived

Ported to 1.21.4


<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
# v1.0.2

Initial re-release
- Pack has been condensed into 2 downloads (one for 1.11/12, and one for every other version)
- Main pack format is for 1.20.1, but works on all versions past (and including) 1.13
- Old CurseForge versions archived
