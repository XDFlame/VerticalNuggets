XDFlame - making the original pack, with support from 1.11 to 1.20
vizthex - porting and maintaining the pack past v1.0

partial credit goes to all the devs of the supported mods, but at the same time if they'd just made proper textures in the first place i wouldn't have to fix them all with this pack lol.
